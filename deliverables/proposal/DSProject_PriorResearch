of a talk. 

-No correlation between the length of a talk and it's number of views

-Possible non-linear correlation with the number of words per minute and view for
a talk

-Culture is the subject that garners the highest median number of views per talk,
but all subjects are relatively close suggesting not a very strong correlation
between talk subject and the number of views but possibly a slight one. Culture
also has the biggest spread on it's view distribution

-Most common themes are Technology and Science

-Medium correlation between the number of languages a talk has been translated
into and the number of views

-There is a medium correlation between the occupation of the speaker and the 
number of views the talk receives. Psychologist have the highest view counts
with writers as the second highest and also the biggest spread. 

-Nearly half of the top ten viewed talks are about religion or have religous
undertones

-Strong correlation between whether the talk was given on a week day or not and
the number of views it received. Talks on weekdays had far more views than talks
on weekends

-No strong correlation between month of the year and view count
